# Interactivity Planning
- I will have two circles or "balls" starting with a random diameter.
- To determine if the objects are touching, I will determine whether the distance from the center of one ball to the center of another ball is equal to the radius of one of the balls plus the other. 
- Every time the balls touch I will have them grow larger and then also bounce In order to do this, I will have them bounce by swapping dx and dy.

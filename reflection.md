# **Interactivity Reflection**
For this assignment I created a program that could simulate two balls moving and bouncing where each time the balls came into contact, they would grow in size. The most challenging part of this feature was understnading it conceptually and determining how to implement it into my code. While I was coding, I learned that if I simply increased the size of the balls after they bounced, they would come into contact again and grow in size again and so on, resulting in a sort of positive feedback loop. After thinking about it, I realized that in my conditional to determine if the balls were touching, I would have to first "teleport" the balls away on their new path (after bouncing/coming into contact) by the distance that I increased their radius by, then increase their radius. This was difficult to implement into code, but it allowed me to better understand that the structure and order of my code is extremely important.
